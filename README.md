Emitter 3Ditor for Arma3 translations

Here are the two stringtables used in Emitter 3Ditor.
They include the tooltips, tutorials and the messages/notes the tool may show.

The tool UI is not translatable, and will never be so bear that in mind when doing these translations.
As in probably not good practise to translate words that are on the UI...
